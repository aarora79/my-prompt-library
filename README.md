# My Prompt Library

A curated collection of prompt templates designed primarily for Claude models to perform complex analytical and educational tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains structured prompt templates that leverage advanced prompting techniques to extract maximum value from AI interactions. Each prompt is carefully crafted to guide the AI through systematic analysis using proven frameworks and methodologies.

## Prompt Collection

### 1. Academic Paper Analysis (Feynman Technique)
**Location:** `prompts/understand-academic-paper/`

Analyzes academic papers using the Feynman Technique to break down complex research into understandable concepts. The prompt guides through:
- Core concept identification in simple language
- Teaching methodology as if explaining to a 12-year-old
- Gap identification in understanding
- Simplification and reorganization
- Critical analysis and technical deep-dive

**Files:**
- `template.txt` - Generic template with placeholder for any paper URL
- `example-arxiv-*.txt` - Specific examples with actual paper URLs
- `result-*.md` - Analysis results after running the prompts

### 2. Stock Portfolio Analysis (Aswath Damodaran Framework)
**Location:** `prompts/stock-portfolio-damodaran/`

Analyzes stocks and portfolios using Professor Aswath Damodaran's valuation principles and investment philosophy. Covers:
- Intrinsic value calculations
- Risk assessment and cost of capital
- Story vs. numbers reconciliation
- Market pricing analysis
- Margin of safety evaluation

## Usage

1. Navigate to the desired prompt template folder
2. Copy the `template.txt` file
3. Replace placeholder values (URLs, stock symbols, etc.) with your specific inputs
4. Copy and paste the hydrated prompt into Claude Desktop, Perplexity, or your AI assistant of choice
5. Save the results in the corresponding results file

## Prompt Design Principles

Each prompt template follows these design principles:

1. **Structured Framework**: Uses established methodologies (Feynman Technique, Damodaran's valuation approach)
2. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Breaks down complex analysis into manageable steps
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Encourages examination from different angles
4. **Clarity Focus**: Emphasizes understanding over superficial coverage
5. **Actionable Output**: Produces practical, usable insights

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest new prompt templates or improvements to existing ones. Each prompt should:
- Solve a specific analytical need
- Use a proven framework or methodology
- Include clear instructions and expected outputs
- Provide example usage

## Future Additions

Planned prompt templates:
- Code review using SOLID principles


## License

MIT-0 License - These prompt templates are shared for educational and analytical purposes with no restrictions. Feel free to adapt, modify, and distribute them for any use.

## Notes

- These prompts work best with Claude 4 models but can be adapted for other LLMs
- Results quality depends on the model's capabilities and training data
- **Use at your own risk** - These prompts are for educational purposes only
- Always verify critical analysis, especially for investment decisions
- No guarantee of accuracy - AI models can hallucinate or provide incorrect information
- Consult qualified professionals for financial, academic, or other specialized advice
